    /// The `coinbase` function performs a four-part emission distribution process involving
    /// subnets, epochs, hotkeys, and nominators.
    // It is divided into several steps, each handling a specific part of the distribution:

    // Step 1: Compute the block-wise emission for each subnet.
    // This involves calculating how much (TAO) should be emitted into each subnet using the
    // root epoch function.

    // Step 2: Accumulate the subnet block emission.
    // After calculating the block-wise emission, these values are accumulated to keep track
    // of how much each subnet should emit before the next distribution phase. This accumulation
    // is a running total that gets updated each block.

    // Step 3: Distribute the accumulated emissions through epochs.
    // Subnets periodically distribute their accumulated emissions to hotkeys (active validators/miners)
    // in the network on a `tempo` --- the time between epochs. This step runs Yuma consensus to
    // determine how emissions are split among hotkeys based on their contributions and roles.
    // The accumulation of hotkey emissions is done through the `accumulate_hotkey_emission` function.
    // The function splits the rewards for a hotkey amongst itself and its `parents`. The parents are
    // the hotkeys that are delegating their stake to the hotkey.
