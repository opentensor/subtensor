# AI Review — Operational Notes

This directory contains the persona prompts and supporting scripts for the
two-persona AI PR review driven by [`ai-review.yml`](../workflows/ai-review.yml).

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `common.md` | Shared review context (repo topology, branch policy, output discipline) |
| `skeptic.md` | Skeptic persona: security review, static-only, no network or build |
| `auditor.md` | Auditor persona: domain review after Skeptic clears |
| `prefetch.sh` | Pre-fetches all GitHub context into `/tmp/ai-review-context/` so Codex doesn't need tokens or network |
| `gittensor-accounts.txt` | Nucleus-curated supplement to the on-chain Gittensor index |
| `known-gittensor-accounts.json` | Auto-maintained on-chain index |
| `index_gittensor.py` | Indexer that walks the SN74 `issues-v0` contract to build the index |

## Required repo secrets

| Secret | Used by | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Codex (skeptic + auditor) | **Yes** |

## Optional — GitHub App for narrow-scope tokens

If left unconfigured, the workflow uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. To narrow
the blast radius of any token leak, configure a dedicated GitHub App and the
workflow will automatically use its token instead.

### Setup

1. Create a GitHub App under the `opentensor` org:
   - Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App.
   - Webhook: not needed; disable.
   - Repository permissions:
     - **Pull requests**: Read & Write (for comments + body edits)
     - **Contents**: Read & Write (for auditor auto-fix commits)
     - **Issues**: Read & Write (for sticky issue comments)
     - **Metadata**: Read
   - User permissions: none.
   - "Where can this GitHub App be installed?": Only on this account.
2. Install the App on the `opentensor/subtensor` repo (only).
3. From the App settings page, generate a private key (`.pem` file).
4. In repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
   - Variables tab: add `AI_REVIEW_APP_ID` = the App's numeric ID.
   - Secrets tab: add `AI_REVIEW_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` = the contents of the `.pem`.

The workflow detects `AI_REVIEW_APP_ID` and mints a short-lived installation
token via [`actions/create-github-app-token`](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token).
Token lifetime is 1 hour; permissions are exactly what the App grants and
nothing more. The token is masked in logs and is never passed to Codex.

## Security model

| Trust boundary | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Persona prompts can be modified by PR | Loaded from base branch via `git show origin/$BASE:...` into `/tmp/ai-review-trusted/`; PR-side copies are never loaded |
| Codex prompt-injection might call `gh` | Codex runs with no `GH_TOKEN` and no `OPENAI_API_KEY` in env; prefetch step holds tokens, post-comment step holds tokens; Codex only reads files |
| Malicious `build.rs` in PR-added dep | Same env-stripping above means cargo subprocesses inherit no tokens; `drop-sudo` strategy removes sudo from the runner |
| Upstream Gittensor compromise | Indexer workflow installs gittensor pinned to commit SHA, runs in a job with `contents: read` only; a separate job with `contents: write` publishes the resulting JSON via PR — never executing third-party code |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` leakage from Codex | Held only in the proxy's process memory (codex-action handles this), shielded by `drop-sudo` |

## Updating pinned action versions

Every third-party action used in the AI-review workflows is pinned to an
immutable commit SHA (with the major-version tag in a trailing comment), e.g.
`openai/codex-action@e0fdf01220eb9a88167c4898839d273e3f2609d1 # v1`. Mutable
tags like `@v1` would let an upstream maintainer (or compromised account)
silently swap in attacker-controlled code that runs with our OpenAI key and
GitHub App credentials.

To update a pinned action:

```bash
# Look up the current SHA for the desired ref
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/git/refs/tags/<ref> --jq '.object.sha'
```

Open a PR that updates the SHA and the trailing version comment. The skeptic
will re-evaluate the change.

## Fork PR handling

Auto-trigger (`pull_request`) on a fork PR is skipped. Repository secrets
(`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AI_REVIEW_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`) are not exposed to
`pull_request` runs from forks and the default token is read-only, so the
Codex steps cannot run. The `decide` job detects this case and clears
`run_skeptic` / `run_auditor`, which causes the persona jobs to skip and the
required checks (`ai-review / skeptic`, `ai-review / auditor`) to resolve as
`skipped`, satisfying branch protection.

This means fork PRs are not AI-reviewed by default. The human nucleus reviewer
is the trust mechanism for fork content. If a maintainer wants AI review on a
specific fork PR, they can invoke this workflow via `workflow_dispatch` with
the PR number — that runs in base context with secrets available.

## Required-checks setup

After the first successful run, add these to branch protection on `devnet-ready`
(and other protected branches) under Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules:

- `ai-review / skeptic`
- `ai-review / auditor`

## Index refresh

Manual trigger:

```bash
gh workflow run ai-review-index-gittensor.yml --repo opentensor/subtensor
```

Daily cron is already configured (06:17 UTC). The indexer opens a PR with any
new entries; nucleus reviews and merges.
